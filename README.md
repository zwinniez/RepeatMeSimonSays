## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   [I didn't use any other outside resources to help me complete my work.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   [One of the challenges was figuring out the connections between the script.js file and the index.html. While I was
   writing out the code, specifically for the four color buttons, it was hard for me to initially figure out
   why some things are considered to be js and others are just scripted in html. The project did help me
   better understand the difference now in which the js file has all of the functionalities of the game defined in it.
   A way for me to overcome it was definitely just understanding the connection between the two, looking between
   the files and seeing why the things were the way they were! In the end, it was actually really nice to
   experience how everything came together. I even found it it easy to debug since once I figured out what the
   bug was, I knew it is was of how something looked or a certain functionality of the game itself.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   [I want to learn how this works on a bigger scale. How is data managed? I know how to use database management systems but
   how do you deploy it to a certain website where clients are able to browse certain things? How does get and post work?
   I am interested in full stack as well, seeing how everything comes through from front end to back end to database management
   to API calls.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   [If I had a few more hours, I would want to make this game possibly into a piano simon says game!
   I love to play piano as a hobby and if I can convert this into a game where the user follows the
   computer to play a certain riff, I think that would be awesome! I would have the buttons look like
   piano keys as well, and have them light up in right when a key is pressed. That being said, the
   clueHoldTime wouldn't be a const anymore (there would be different hold times for different
   notes). ]
